My professional journey has been defined by a commitment to technical excellence and innovation. At Crest Data, I architected backend systems for Splunk Enterprise Security using Java Spring Boot, achieving a 96% reduction in release cycles through CI/CD optimization. I have also collaborated with international teams, including Google, to design high-performance systems that process data at scale. My technical expertise spans Java, Spring Framework, React.js, microservices architecture, and cloud platforms (AWS/GCP), enabling me to deliver end-to-end solutions that align with business objectives.

• Leading technical initiatives and mentoring development teams on best practices and design patterns

Beyond my current technical contributions, I am focused on advancing my career toward a Solutions Architect and Technical Lead role. I am passionate about combining deep technical knowledge with strategic thinking to drive architectural decisions, foster team collaboration, and deliver innovative solutions. This techno-managerial path aligns with my long-term goal of leading engineering teams while remaining hands-on with cutting-edge technologies.

I am actively seeking opportunities that provide visa sponsorship, as I am committed to relocating to [Country/Region] and building a long-term career with [Company Name]. My experience working in Agile environments, collaborating with global stakeholders, and adapting to diverse technical challenges has prepared me to thrive in international settings.

I would be delighted to discuss how my background in Java development, microservices, and full-stack engineering can support [Company Name]'s objectives. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to your team's success.

Yours sincerely,
